# Tim Rozmajzl

ðŸ‘‹ Father of eight, husband of one.  Traditional Catholic who loves Christ's Church and the centuries of beauty and wisdom handed down as tradition. An adherent of the Austrian School of Economics and optimistic Anarcho-Capitalist. Have been a software practitioner since 1995 and love what I do. Software is primarily about people - technology cool, but secondary - a means to an end.

## Interests

Iâ€™m interested in building life-changing software/data solutions - or wherever the Lord wants to take me.

## Learning

Iâ€™m currently learning Hugo, OpenMetadata, dbt, Snowflake, Streamlit, and much, much more!! This list changes constantly, so I'll have to be sure to refresh this page frequently.

## Let's Collaborate

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on just about anything _edifying_, challenging, and meaningful.
